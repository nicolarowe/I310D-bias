What I did not expect was for `afr_avg` to be lower than `asia_avg` and `na_avg`. Given the social weight of certain slurs in the African group, I was expecting that average to be relatively much higher than the averages for the other non-European groups.\n",

    "### Conclusions and Takeaways\n",
    "So, is there bias in the Perspective algorithm model? Yes, in a few different ways.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the one predicted by my hypothesis: lower `identity_hate` scores for derogatory terms against Europeans. This is unsurprising because of the relative prevalence of slurs against the other groups in English-speaking spaces online compared to those against Europeans. With Europeans holding most positions of power in the Western world, especially in North America, these words hold less weight against them. Slurs against other groups have much stronger negative connotation because of the use of language to oppress groups both historically and contemporarily. 'Jap', for example, was used to mark East Asians as being part of a traitorous, un-American group during Japanese internment.\n",
    "\n",
    "Understandably, the algorithm also shows bias of scoring more ambiguous words lower than common ones. Ambiguity in both denotation and connotation can be difficult to determine without context for even a human; if one heard the word 'Nip' without context, they would likely assume it to be the verb given the relative prevalence of that denotation in the modern English-speaking world. It's possible that the algorithm behaves in much the same way: showing a preference for the most likely interpretation in the face of uncertainty.\n",
    "\n",
    "A slur being less common doesn't mean that it's not identity hate, however. Throughout analysis, I was careful to avoid the language 'false positive' because *every* word prompted to the algorithm should have been a positive; when used in certain contexts, all of these words become hateful remarks against one's perceived racial identity. Since the algorithm doesn't have much experience interpreting less common slurs, though, it has a much higher false negative rate when scoring them. I can't even entirely fault the algorithm for this—even I didn't realize 'Eggplant' could be used as a racist remark before beginning this project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we know there are biases, how do we account for them in our use of the Perspective API?\n",
    "\n",
    "In a large-scale use of this API for content moderation, it's counterproductive and infeasible to suggest relying on humans to double-check results. Instead, the threshold for marking a comment as identity hate should be lower. Further tests would need to be performed in order to ensure there aren't too many false positives, but a threshold of 0.35, for example, would catch all concerning false negatives aforementioned with the exception of 'Nip', 'Chinaman', and 'B\\*\\*\\*\\*\\*r'. When finding this balance, content moderators should be more concerned with false negatives than false positives. While censorship should be avoided, it's preferable to having such harmful content online.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the developer side, the algorithm should be presented with more training data explicitly including harmful terms such as the ones tested here. Making an effort to specifically train the algorithm on hateful terms will improve the quality of content moderation using the Perspective model and make the places in which its used more welcoming to the victims of this language."

    "### Limitations\n",
    "There are, of course, a number of limitations with this project. The source from which the test words were gathered, Wikipedia, can be edited by anyone with the will to do so. Thus, the words defined in that article are up to the subjective discretion of the page contributors and, as such, likely lacks a number of racist terms used in North America. The number of racial insults is, unfortunately, near-impossible to pin down because of the ever-changing nature of language and word connotation. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, the selection of words analyzed here is Euro-centric. As noted in my omission conditions, words not in use in any of the North American countries (as defined by the contributors) were not included in my test data set. Another factor contributing to the Euro-centric nature of this project was my decision to use only the English functions of the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another rather important one is the subjectivity of my analysis. Coming from the perspective of a white Texan, I'm sure there's history and nuance to certain terms in my test data that I'm missing. Thus, my designation of \"concerning false negatives\" comes from my own experiences as a white person and the exposure I have had to the experiences of American minorities. In future iterations of this project, it would be vital to research racist language and the perspectives of those who are targeted by it."
